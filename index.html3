    <p style="color :blue">The batting team stays up to bat until the fielding team puts out 3 batters. A softball field consists of a pitching rubber, 4 bases (3 bases plus home plate), an infield, and an outfield. You need a bat, a softball, and softball gloves for each fielder, 4 bases, and a pitching rubber.</p>

      <p style="color : red">A softball game can last anywhere from 3 to 7 innings, depending on the league, rules, and type of softball; however 7 innings is the most common. In each inning, each team bats until three batters have been put out (see below). The teams take turns batting.</p>
